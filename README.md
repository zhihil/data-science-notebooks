# Setup
This repository uses pipenv to manage packages. See [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) for documentation on Pipenv.

The Jupyter notebooks were setup for use in VSCode. To set up the local notebooks in your local environment, you will need to:

1. Copy-paste the `.local.vscode` folder
2. Rename the `.local.vscode` folder to `.vscode`. This hooks up the local environment with the noteboooks when running it on VSCode
